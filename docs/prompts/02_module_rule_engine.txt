2. **Public Interfaces / APIs** – list all public classes, methods, or endpoints and describe their roles.
3. **Internal Design** – explain key classes, data structures, algorithms, and their relationships.
4. **Dependencies** – list internal and external dependencies (other modules, libraries, services).
5. **Data Flow / Sequence** – describe the flow of data or control inside the module, optionally using a sequence diagram.
6. **UML Diagram** – represent class/component relationships using PlantUML diagram.
