ThingsBoard is an open-source IoT (Internet of Things) platform designed to collect, process, visualize, and manage data from connected devices at scale. Built as a Spring Boot Java application with an Angular frontend, it provides a comprehensive solution for IoT deployments by supporting multiple device communication protocols (MQTT, HTTP, CoAP, LWM2M, SNMP), implementing an event-driven rule engine for real-time data processing and transformation, offering multi-tenant architecture for enterprise use, and enabling flexible deployment as either a monolithic application or distributed microservices. The platform handles the complete lifecycle of IoT data—from device authentication and data ingestion through transport layers, to processing via configurable rule chains, storage in time-series and relational databases, and finally visualization through real-time dashboards and widgets—while providing REST APIs for integration and management, making it suitable for building production-grade IoT applications across various industries.
